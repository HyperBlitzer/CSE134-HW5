            <p> 
                Hey, I am a 4th year MATH-CS major in Muir. My hobbies include programming, video games, board games and game development. 
                Within the realm of CS I enjoy embedded systems and computer graphics. Some video games I am currently playing right now include
                Overwatch 2, Marvel Rivals and Dead By Daylight. Some of my favorite board games include: Wingspan, Root and Binding of Isaac Four souls.
