I divided the contents of the project into seperate pages (index, about, contact, portfolio) to not cram so much info into a single page.
Added visual pizzazz to the page such as, adding favicons to each page, images to the about and icons to the contact section to make the project
less bland. Along with this I also changed the main palette of the page to focus on a specific shade of color (green) instead of a clashing color scheme of green and blue. Added media queries that restructure the portfolio page from 2 per column into 1 and the contents inside the project-card become hamburger style.
